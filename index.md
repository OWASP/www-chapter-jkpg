Manipulating people has always been a beneficial approach for criminals. This
also applies to our digital world. Social engineering is a tool used by
criminals in cyber-attacks and it targets the user - you. Social engineering is
about manipulating people to perform actions or disclosing confidential
information. But how does it work?

As a behavioural scientist, Hanna Ljung has a deep understanding of human
psychology and complex behaviour. She is an ethical hacker and will share real
life stories from when she herself used social engineering to attack
organizations and its users. Today, Hanna works as a security awareness expert
and her goal is to reduce human risk, "By supporting our users to become more
security-aware, we are simultaneously minimizing the cyber-criminals attack
surface".  Questions you will get answered during this session:

- What is social engineering?
- How is social engineering used in a cyber-attack?
- Why are you a target?

## The Automated Society - Dystopia, Utopia, or something in between?

**Speaker:** Niklas Lavesson, Jönköping University

**Date:** 2021-01-28

**Time:** 19:00

More details coming soon.
